## About me

---

<br>

Hey there! Welcome to my personal page!

<br>

I’m excited to share a bit about myself and the cool projects I’ve been working on.

<br>

I’ve been hooked on programming since I was a kid. Coming up with creative software solutions is what I love to do. This website is my way of showing what I can do.

<br>

I recently wrapped up my Software Engineering degree (HBO) and now I'm diving into personal projects while working full-time as a Software Consultant.

<br>

I have experience in both backend and frontend development. This website is built with Angular and is pre-rendered from Markdown content to ensure a seamless user experience.

<br>

Performance is crucial in web development. A fast, responsive application keeps users engaged and improves overall satisfaction. That's why I believe performance should always be a primary focus.
