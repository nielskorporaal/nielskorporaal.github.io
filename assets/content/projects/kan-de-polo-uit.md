## Kan de polo uit?

---

<br>

I partnered with the dutch police to craft a simple static website that tells you whether the weather at your current location allows for a polo shirt.

#### Used technologies

- __HTML/CSS__: Used for building the interactive and dynamic parts of the site.
- __Javascript__: Fetch the estimated geolocation of the visitor.
- __Weather API__: Fetch the forecasted daily maximum temperature for the provided geolocation.
- __Google Analytics__: Monitor visitor activity with the help of the Google Analytics service.

This project not only demonstrates my technical skills but also highlights my ability to learn and apply new technologies effectively. Each tool and technology was carefully selected to improve different aspects of the portfolio, from user experience to performance and code quality.

Building this static website has been a rewarding journey, and I'm proud of the knowledge and expertise I've gained along the way.
