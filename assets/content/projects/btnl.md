Beach tennis is an exciting and rapidly growing sport, but information about it is not easily found online. To address this issue, the Beach Tennis Netherlands website was developed. This platform shows different playing venues and locations, and offers a place where players can get in touch with trainers and organizers. Additionally, tournament organizers can use this website to showcase upcoming tournaments, making it a comprehensive resource for the beach tennis community.
