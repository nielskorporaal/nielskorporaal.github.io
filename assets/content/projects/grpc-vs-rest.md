## gRPC vs REST

---

<br>

During my graduation internship I researched various ways to achieve higher performance in complex, distributed environments.

<br>

I focused on different data exchange protocols and researched developer experience and scalability.

<br>

#### Used technologies
- __gRPC__: A high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, load balancing, and more. Used for achieving low-latency, high-throughput communication between microservices.
- __REST__: A widely adopted architectural style for designing networked applications, relying on stateless communication and standard HTTP methods. Used for its simplicity and ease of integration with web technologies.
- __SOAP__: A protocol for exchanging structured information in web services implementation, using XML as its message format and typically relying on HTTP/HTTPS for transport. Used for its robustness and features such as built-in error handling and security.
- __Kafka__: A distributed event streaming platform capable of handling real-time data feeds with high throughput and low latency. Used for building real-time data pipelines and stream processing applications.
- __Angular__: A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Used for developing the frontend of the application, providing a robust structure and reusable components.
- __Typescript__: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Employed to ensure type safety and make the code more maintainable.
- __DotNetBenchmark__: A benchmarking tool for .NET applications that provides insights into performance and helps identify bottlenecks. Used for performance testing and optimization of the .NET components in the application.
- __k6__: An open-source load testing tool designed for testing the performance of APIs, microservices, and websites. Used for simulating high traffic and stress-testing the application to ensure it can handle large volumes of requests.
- __Virtual Machines__: Emulated computing environments that provide the functionality of a physical computer. Used to create isolated testing environments, simulate various deployment scenarios, and assess the performance and scalability of the application in different configurations.
