I recently completed this portfolio project, and it has been a tremendous learning experience for me. This site you are browsing is the result of that effort. Working on this project allowed me to explore and master several modern technologies.

#### Used technologies

- __Angular__: Used for building the interactive and dynamic parts of the site.
- __Typescript__: Employed to ensure type safety and make the code more maintainable.
- __TailwindCSS__: Utilized for styling the site efficiently with utility-first CSS.
- __Markdown__: Used for easy and readable content creation.
- __SSR/SSG__: Implemented Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation to boost performance and SEO.

This project not only demonstrates my technical skills but also highlights my ability to learn and apply new technologies effectively. Each tool and technology was carefully selected to improve different aspects of the portfolio, from user experience to performance and code quality.

Building this portfolio has been a rewarding journey, and I'm proud of the knowledge and expertise I've gained along the way.
