## Tech

---

<br>

At my previous job, I got to work with custom software in a lab, which meant dealing with all sorts of lab devices like robots, printers, scanners, and other electronic measurement instruments. We used interfaces like RS232 and later USB to get these devices to talk to each other.

#### Backend

For backend development, I specialize in C#. I mainly use frameworks like Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core, and I also work with libraries such as AutoMapper, Serilog, Seq, and FluentValidation to make the development process smoother and more efficient.

<br>

#### Front-end

On the frontend side, I work with Vue, Nuxt, and Angular. Right now, I'm involved in a Nuxt project, and this website is built with Angular. I chose Angular because it's great to work with and is widely used in the industry, making it a reliable choice for building modern web applications.

<br>

I'm really passionate about performance and always look for ways to make my code more efficient. I'm a big fan of Performance Aware Programming, which means I focus on writing code that runs as fast as possible. For my graduation project, I researched how to improve communication between microservices using RPC and gRPC. I discovered that by using smarter communication methods, we could make data exchanges happen in microseconds instead of milliseconds or even seconds.

<br>

In my professional work, I use gRPC to speed things up on a lower level. I've talked to many experts to find and fix performance bottlenecks in live applications. For instance, in a lab setting, I helped change the workflow so that we could handle multiple batches individually instead of all at once, which made the process much faster.

<br>

I've faced challenges like dealing with old, outdated code, working in small teams, and tackling big, difficult problems. Communication and teamwork have been key to overcoming these obstacles!
